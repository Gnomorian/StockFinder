This is an application I made to track stock at my workplace. It was quite useful but tedious to add new items. I had planned changes to fix this such as a [WebCrawler](https://github.com/Gnomorian/TheWarehouseSpider) to automaticly populate the names, barcodes, categories of products for me, I just had to add their location.

This project is Archived now. It is Functional however I dont work there anymore so have no reason to use it.

please feel fry to copy it.
